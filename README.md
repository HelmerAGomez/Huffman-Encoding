# Huffman-Encoding
This project was made using Python. The goal of this program is to compress the contents of a file to reduce the size it takes up in memory. The compression is an example of losseless compression using the Huffman encoding method. This program will ask the user for a file to compress and it will also show the contents of the file that was compressed. It is not a full implementation of the Huffman encoding as the file that is being compressed does not include the encoding map to decompress the file but shows the general goal of what a compressing alogrithm can achieve.
